## Personal static website
Welcome to my portfolio!

This is a site that gives you some information about me and showcases some of my projects.
View it here: [Portfolio](https://DanieleMorotti.github.io).

At [this link](https://danielemorotti.github.io/projects/SegnapuntiGenerico/index.html) you can find the **SegnapuntiGenerico** Progressive Web App. It's a simple app to keep track of the scores of different players and it can be used for every game.
The PWA is optimized for *ios* devices and in general it has been implemented with a **mobile first** approach. 

If any bugs or errors appear, fell free to contact me!
